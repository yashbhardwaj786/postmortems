**This website is built with Jekyll**. It is fully compatible with Github pages, where it is actually hosted. 

# What is Jekyll?

No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install-just your content. **Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS go in**. Static sites come out ready for deployment. Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.

You create your content as text files (Markdown). Check [help](/help) for more information and examples.

# Contribute using Pull requests

Feel free to contribute either by requesting features (through the [issues section](https://github.com/inspiredness/inspiredness.github.io/issues)) or collaborating with new articles:
- [Clone the repo](https://github.com/inspiredness/inspiredness.github.io).
- Create a branch off of master and give it a meaningful name (e.g. my-new-post or my-new-feature).
- Open a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/inspiredness/inspiredness.github.io) and describe the feature, fix or post.
