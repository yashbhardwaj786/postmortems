Wire Postmortem Project
=========================

This is a jekyll project for:
* [https://wireapp.github.io/postmortems/](https://wireapp.github.io/postmortems/)

**This website is built with Jekyll**. It uses a fork of the website [Inspiredness.io](https://inspiredness.io/) by [Fernando Cejas](https://fernandocejas.com/) which was **customized** for the purpose of this project. It is fully compatible with Github pages, where it is actually hosted.

## What is Jekyll?

No more databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install-just your content. **Markdown, Liquid, HTML & CSS go in**. Static sites come out ready for deployment. Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens here.

**GitHub Pages are powered by Jekyll,** so you can easily deploy your site using GitHub for free-custom domain name and all.
**Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.**

You create your content as text files (Markdown), and organize them into folders. Then, you build the shell of your site using Liquid-enhanced HTML templates. **Jekyll automatically stitches the content and templates together, generating a website made entirely of static assets, suitable for uploading to any server.**

Jekyll happens to be the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your project’s Jekyll page/blog/website on GitHub’s servers for free.


## Quick Start Guide

**If you already have a full Ruby development environment** (go to the Bundler section on this page for more information) with all headers and RubyGems installed (see Jekyll’s requirements), you can create a new Jekyll site by doing the following:

```ruby
# Install Jekyll and Bundler gems through RubyGems
gem install jekyll bundler

# Create a new Jekyll site at ./myblog
jekyll new myblog

# Change into your new directory
cd myblog

# Build the site on the preview server
bundle exec jekyll serve

# Now browse to http://localhost:4000
```

## About Bundler

`gem install bundler` installs the bundler gem through RubyGems. You only need to install it once - not every time you create a new Jekyll project. Here are some additional details:
{: .text-justify}

`bundler` is a gem that manages other Ruby gems. It makes sure your gems and gem versions are compatible, and that you have all necessary dependencies each gem requires.
{: .text-justify}

The `Gemfile` and `Gemfile.lock` files inform `Bundler` about the gem requirements in your site. If your site doesn’t have these Gemfiles, you can omit `bundle exec` and just `run jekyll serve`.
{: .text-justify}

When you run `bundle exec jekyll serve`, `Bundler` uses the gems and versions as specified in `Gemfile.lock` to ensure your Jekyll site builds with no compatibility or dependency conflicts.
